# Sprint 5: Next Major Feature (Property)
  * We implemented the Property feature
  * Now a user can update their property with some information:
    * Rent
    * Amenities
    * Location
    * etc
  
# Sprint 5-2: Top Matching
  * `Top Matching` will show a list of profile cards that suits your preference.
  * If a user wants to match with people who do not have properties, the `Top Matching` feature will show a list of profile cards that are also looking for properties. It helps connect them to find a property together. 
  * If a user wants to match with people who DO have properties, the `Top Matching` feature will show a list of profile cards that have a property and are looking for roomates. It helps to connect them directly.

# Sprint 5-3: Another API
  * We used another third-party API `Twilio` to implement a mega chat forum where all users can have conversation in one place synchronously.
